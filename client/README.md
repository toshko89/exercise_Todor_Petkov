Server is build with Express + MongoDB, allowing creating new products 
The React app is using Redux to keep the orders in cart and react-router-dom for navigation 
React MUI is used for the Components

When creating a new product all fields are required, otherwise Error message will pop-up.
The user can define name,price,IMG URL and Deal for the new product.

Even if the server is not running, there is a mockedProductData.js file with 4 items, so the cart functionality may be checked.
